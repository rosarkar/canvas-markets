# Canvas Edge — Autonomous Sports-Trading Agent

**Superteam "World Cup" Hackathon · Track: Trading Tools & Agents · TxODDS × Solana**

An autonomous, **risk-managed** trading agent that follows the sponsor's own blueprint:
**TxLINE (Solana, on-chain-verified World Cup data) → agent logic → Bankr executes on
Polymarket (cross-chain).** It streams live odds and scores, sizes every position with the
**Kelly criterion** under hard risk limits, and — the headline play — reacts *the instant a
goal is verified on-chain*.

> Most trading bots blow up because they over-bet. Canvas Edge is built the other way round:
> it will find an edge, size it with fractional Kelly, and **halt itself** on a ruin-stop or a
> daily loss cap before it ever busts.

## What it does

- **Value-edge strategy** — compares TxLINE StablePrice (de-margined fair prob) to the market
  price, and bets outcomes with real positive EV. Sizes with `assessSelection` (Kelly + ruin +
  Sharpe from our Markets risk engine).
- **Goal-trigger strategy** — consumes the TxLINE scores SSE stream; on a goal it verifies the
  event **on-chain** (`validate_stat` / `daily_scores_roots` PDA) and trades the transient
  dislocation before the market reprices.
- **Risk management** — half-Kelly default, per-trade max stake, **daily loss cap**, and a
  **ruin-stop** that halts all trading below a bankroll floor. Every limit is live-tunable.
- **Execution via Bankr** — composes the exact `smart_cross_chain_swap` → `buy_polymarket_shares`
  order. Simulated by default; `EXECUTION_MODE=live` + a Bankr key places real orders.
- **Live dashboard** — decisions feed, positions/P&L, realized-equity curve, on-chain proof
  badges, risk gauges, and a kill switch.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run agent          # → http://localhost:4300/agent/
```

Open the dashboard, hit **Start agent**, and watch it evaluate edges, size stakes, and settle.
Drag the risk sliders down and it stops taking bets; push the daily-loss cap and it halts.
**Inject goal** exercises the on-chain-verified goal-trigger. Headless runner: `npm run agent:run`.

## Real Solana data

The agent consumes the shared TxLINE foundation (`src/services/txline/`): an on-chain
`subscribe` + activate flow, StablePrice odds, SSE score streams, and Merkle-proof verification.
With `USE_TXLINE=true` and a funded devnet wallet (`npm run txline:smoke` to bring it up) it
trades on **real on-chain-verified TxLINE data**; otherwise it runs on clearly-labelled sample
World Cup fixtures so the demo always works. See the repo's TxLINE notes for the full flow.

## Honesty

On sample fixtures with simulated settlement, position outcomes are drawn from the fair
probability to illustrate bankroll dynamics — clearly labelled, never presented as real returns.
The risk math is exact and unit-tested. Solana execution is via Bankr (Polygon/Polymarket)
per the sponsor's architecture. Not financial advice.
